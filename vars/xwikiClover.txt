Computes the full Clover TPC for the XWiki project, taking into account all tests located in various repos:
`xwiki-commons`, `xwiki-rendering` and `xwiki-platform`.

Also performs an analysis of the report by comparing it to a previous report and generating an email if some modules
have a global TPC contribution lower than before.

Example usage:

```
import org.xwiki.jenkins.Clover
node('docker') {
    xwikiClover([
        [baseline: "20171222-1835", fail: false],
        [baseline: "20190101-2330", fail: true]
    ])
}
```

Parameters:

* `baselineDefinitions`: list of values corresponding to existing report directories at
  http://maven.xwiki.org/site/clover against which the new report will be compared against. Also specify if
  errors in each diff report should result in an email and failing the job or not.
  Example: `[[baseline: "20171222-1835", fail: false]]`.
