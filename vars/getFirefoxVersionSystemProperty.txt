Used to override the FF binary path since we're on an old branch and we need to use FF 32.0.1 (as testing with a
newer version requires a newer version of Selenium and that in turn requires Guava 21+, which is hard to update and
that we updated in XWiki 11.6+.

Parameters:

* `firefoxVersion`: the FF version to set, e.g. '32.0.1'

Example usage from a Jenkinsfile:

```
node {
  // We need FF 32.0.1 since the tests are still on Selenium 2.x
  def firefoxVersionSystemProperty = getFirefoxVersionSystemProperty()
  xwikiBuild {
    properties = firefoxVersionSystemProperty
  }
}
```
